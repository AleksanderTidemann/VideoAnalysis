time = Time code from video file
QoM = Quantity of motion (sum of pixels in motion image)
HoM = Height of motion (distance between lowest and highest pixel)
WoM = Width of motion (distance between leftmost and rightmost pixel)
AoM = Area of motion (HoM*WoM)
CoM_x = Centroid of motion X (spatial centre of AoM - X component)
CoM_y = Centroid of motion Y (spatial centre of AoM -Y component)
CoM_r = Centroid of motion r (spatial centre of AoM - vector length polar coordinates)
CoM_t = Centroid of motion t (spatial centre of AoM - vector angle polar coordinates)
d_CoM_x = First derivative of CoM_x
d_CoM_y = First derivative of CoM_y
d_CoM_r = First derivative of CoM_r
d_CoM_t = First derivative of CoM_t
dd_CoM_r = Second derivative of CoM_r
dd_CoM_t = Second derivative of CoM_t
circularity = The compactness of the shape (experimental)
perimeter = The perimeter of the shape (experimental)
