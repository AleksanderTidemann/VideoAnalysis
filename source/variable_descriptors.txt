time = Time code from video file
QoM = Quantity of motion (sum of pixels in motion image)
HoM = Height of motion (distance between lowest and highest pixel)
WoM = Width of motion (distance between leftmost and rightmost pixel)
AoM = Area of motion (HoM*WoM)
CoM_x = Centroid of motion X (spatial centre of AoM - X component)
CoM_y = Centroid of motion Y (spatial centre of AoM -Y component)
Circularity = The compactness of the shape (experimental)
Perimeter = The perimeter of the shape (experimental)
