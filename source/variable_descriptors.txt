time			= Time code from video file
time_s			= Time in seconds, calculated from QuickTime time code
qom 			= Quantity of motion (sum of pixels in motion image)
qom_px			= Quantity of motion in pixels
com_x			= Centroid of motion X (spatial centre of AoM - X component)
com_y			= Centroid of motion Y (spatial centre of AoM -Y component)
com_x_px		= Centroid of motion X in pixels
com_y_px		= Centroid of motion Y in pixels
HoM				= Height of motion (distance between lowest and highest pixel)
WoM				= Width of motion (distance between leftmost and rightmost pixel)
AoM				= Area of motion (HoM*WoM)
wom_min_px 		= Width of motion minimum value in pixels
wom_max_px 		= Width of motion maximum value in pixels
hom_min_px 		= Height of motion minimum value in pixels
hom_max_px		= Height of motion maximum value in pixels
