time			= Time code from video file
time_s			= Time in seconds, calculated from QuickTime time code
QoM 			= Quantity of motion (sum of pixels in motion image)
HoM				= Height of motion (distance between lowest and highest pixel)
WoM				= Width of motion (distance between leftmost and rightmost pixel)
AoM				= Area of motion (HoM*WoM)
CoM_x			= Centroid of motion X (spatial centre of AoM - X component)
CoM_y			= Centroid of motion Y (spatial centre of AoM -Y component)
BMi_x			= Bounding box miniumum X
BMi_y			= Bounding box miniumum Y
BMa_x			= Bounding box maximum X
BMa_y			= Bounding box maximum Y
