File structure
--------------
_data.csv = Quantitative data from the analysis see below for details
_log.txt = General information about the analysed file and the analysis
_stats.csv = Basic statistics generated from the _data.txt file
-avg.jpg/png/tif = Average image based on taking the average of all images in video stream
-mavg.jpg/png/tif = Motion average image based on taking the average of all motion images in video stream
-mgx.jpg/png/tif = Horizontal motiongram based on averaging over each column in each motion image
-mgy.jpg/png/tif = Horizontal motiongram based on averaging over each column in each motion image
-mhi_first.jpg/png/tif = Motion history image: displaying motion average image (mavg) on top of first video frame
-mhi_last.jpg/png/tif = Motion history image: displaying motion average image (mavg) on top of last video frame

Data structure
--------------
time = Time code from video file
time_s = Time in seconds calculated from QuickTime time code
QoM = Quantity of motion (sum of pixels in motion image)
HoM = Height of motion (distance between lowest and highest pixel)
WoM = Width of motion (distance between leftmost and rightmost pixel)
AoM = Area of motion (HoM*WoM)
CoM_x = Centroid of motion X (spatial centre of AoM - X component)
CoM_y = Centroid of motion Y (spatial centre of AoM -Y component)
BMi_x = Bounding box miniumum X
BMi_y = Bounding box miniumum Y
BMa_x = Bounding box maximum X
BMa_y = Bounding box maximum Y
