# VideoAnalysis

A standalone application for creating visualizations and extract motion features from video files. 

## Features

- Create various types of visualizations from a video file: motiongrams, motion images, motion history images, etc.
- Open individual video files or batch-process folders of files
- Realtime preview of visualizations
- Extract some basic motion features: quantity of motion, centroid of motion, area of motion

Please see the [tutorial](https://github.com/fourMs/VideoAnalysis/wiki) for more information.

## Demonstration

See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/vvuiir2vDfQ) for a demonstration of how the program works. 


## History

This software project was started by [Alexander Refsum Jensenius](http://people.uio.no/alexanje) in 2003, first in the form of the [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Max](http://www.uio.no/english/research/groups/fourms/downloads/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/). The toolbox later became integrated as the first collection of video modules in the [Jamoma](http://www.jamoma.org) project. 

It turned out that many people found the tools for video visualization useful, but they did not want to invest time in learning how to develop in Max. This led to the development of the standalone VideoAnalysis application, based on modules from the MGT. Over the years, it has been used by a number of researchers and practictioners in fields such as music, dance, medicine, and physiotherapy. 

VideoAnalysis is still aimed to be a complete, standalone and user-frirendly solution. If you want more flexibility, you should check out [Jamoma](http://www.jamoma.org) (for Max), or the [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Matlab](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-matlab/) or [Musical Gestures Toolbox for Python](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-python).
